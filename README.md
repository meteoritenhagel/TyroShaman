# TyroShaman
My final project for the course "Music and Ritual" in the winter semester of 2024/25 at the KUG Graz. All code and assets (unless marked otherwise in Section [Credits](README.md#Credits)) are by me and published under the MIT license. 

# Credits
## Libraries
* The Game Boy hardware definitions `include/hardware.inc` 
* The music library files `include/hUGE.inc`, `include/hUGE_note_table.inc` and `src/hUGEDriver.asm` are from https://github.com/SuperDisk/hUGEDriver, which is "dedicated to the public domain".
## Assets
* The font `res/raw/Public-Pixel.png` is an adaptation made by Santiago Crespo and licensed under the CC0. Based on the original Public-Pixel ttf by GGBotNet, a monospaced font designed to fit in a 8x8 grid (https://santiagocrespo.itch.io/public-pixel-for-gbs). The files  files `res/raw/font.png` and `res/font.2bpp` are derived from this.
* The background assets are by Gumpy Function (gumpyfunction.itch.io), this includes `res/raw/RPG_exterior.png`, `res/raw/RPG_interior.png`, `res/raw/RPG_exterior_example.png`, `res/raw/RPG_interior_example.png`.

* The object assets (`res/raw/Character_MegaPack.png`) are by The Pixel Nook (https://the-pixel-nook.itch.io/gb-studio-character-pack) and licensed under Creative Commons Attribution v4.0 International. In order to give the patients a more scary look, I added some modified sprites to the file.
